## Creative Foraging

Two players silently reshape a connected cluster of 10 blocks into a recognizable silhouette. Each tries to guess what the other is forming. No chattingâ€”only movement speaks. Save finished shapes to a local gallery.

Core rules:
- Always exactly 10 blocks, all orthogonally connected.
- Move one block at a time into an adjacent empty cell without breaking connectivity.
- Players can pass or keep sculpting; finish when the object feels clear.

Have fun exploring emergent shapes and shared imagination.
